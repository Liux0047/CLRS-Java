## Code structure
`MyAlgorithm.java` contains the actual implementation of the algorithm

`MyAlgorithmApp.java` contains the testing and complexity analysis of the algorithm

## Why Java?
The implementation language should have facilities sophisticated enough to allow for easy implementation of data structures, but at the same time not too high level as to provide readily available abstractions of common data structures. The language itself should not be too complex to deflect the purpose of learning algorithms.

Thus the obvious choice of the boring, verbose Java, which apparently everyone knows about.
